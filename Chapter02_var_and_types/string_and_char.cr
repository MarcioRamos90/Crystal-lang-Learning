# Textual data can be represented with the String type: it can store arbitrary amounts of UTF-8 text, providing many utility methods to process and transform it. There is also the Char type, capable of storing a single Unicode code point: a character. Strings are expressed using text between double quotes, and characters use single quotes:

text = "Crystal is cool!"
name = "John"
single_letter = 'X'
